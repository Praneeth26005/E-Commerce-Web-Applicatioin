# E-Commerce-Web-Applicatioin
# Project Overview
The E-Commerce Website is a web application that allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, and purchase them through a simple and user-friendly interface. It simulates the basic workflow of online shopping platforms like Amazon or Flipkart but in a simplified form suitable for learning and academic projects.
